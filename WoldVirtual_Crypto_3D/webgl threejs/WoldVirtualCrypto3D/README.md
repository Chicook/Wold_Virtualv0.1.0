# Metaverse Crypto 3D

## Overview
Metaverse Crypto 3D is an interactive 3D environment built using Three.js for rendering and Reflex as the backend framework. This project aims to create a virtual space where users can interact with 3D models, avatars, and blockchain elements seamlessly.

## Architecture
The project is structured into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React with Three.js
- **Purpose**: To provide an immersive 3D experience, allowing users to navigate and interact with the virtual environment.
- **Key Components**:
  - **MetaverseScene**: Encapsulates the Three.js scene, managing the rendering of 3D objects and interactions.
  - **Avatar**: Represents the user's avatar in the 3D environment, handling appearance and animations.
  - **HUD**: Displays relevant information to the user.
  - **Menu**: Provides navigation through the application.
  - **Chat**: Enables communication between users.

### Backend
- **Technology**: Python with Reflex
- **Purpose**: To manage business logic, state management, and blockchain integration.
- **Key Components**:
  - **State Management**: Classes to manage the overall state of the metaverse, user data, scene data, and blockchain interactions.
  - **API Endpoints**: For scene management, user authentication, and blockchain interactions.
  - **Database**: Models for users, scenes, and assets.

## Features
- **3D Rendering**: Load and visualize complex 3D models (glTF, FBX) with realistic textures and materials.
- **Lighting and Effects**: Implement dynamic lighting systems and post-processing effects for enhanced visuals.
- **User Interaction**: Manage camera controls and user interactions with 3D objects.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques like frustum culling and level of detail (LOD) to ensure smooth performance across devices.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interact with blockchain elements for asset ownership and transactions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd metaverse-crypto-3d
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
