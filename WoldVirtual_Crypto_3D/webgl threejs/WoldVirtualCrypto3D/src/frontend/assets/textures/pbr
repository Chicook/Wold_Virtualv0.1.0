The file /metaverse-crypto-3d/metaverse-crypto-3d/src/frontend/assets/textures/pbr is intended to store PBR texture assets. Since you have not specified any particular textures to include, I will create a placeholder file indicating that this directory is for PBR textures.

Here are the contents for the file:

# This directory is intended for PBR texture assets used in the Three.js scenes.
